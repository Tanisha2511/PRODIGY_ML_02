# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering Based on Purchase History

## Project Overview
This project aims to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The segmentation will help in understanding different customer groups and tailoring marketing strategies to better meet their needs.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Mall Customers](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Goals
- Implement K-Means clustering on customer purchase history data.
- Analyze and interpret the resulting customer segments.
- Provide actionable insights for targeted marketing and customer relationship management.

## Files
- `Mall_Customers.csv`: The dataset used for clustering.
- `customer_segmentation_kmeans.py`: The main script containing the K-Means clustering implementation and visualizations.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

##  Results
The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method. The final clusters reveal distinct customer segments based on their annual income and spending score. These segments can be used for targeted marketing strategies.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of K-Means clustering in segmenting customers based on their purchase history. The resulting segments provide valuable insights for marketing and customer relationship management.
