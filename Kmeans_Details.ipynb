    "Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of modern retail strategy. By understanding and grouping customers based on their purchase history, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts, improve customer satisfaction, and ultimately increase sales. In this project, we will use the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their purchase behavior."
